description: In this part of The Eric Experiment, we'll build an ultra compatible and versatile retro computer around the Intel Pentium MMX 233mhz.

This video has been in the back of my mind for years. Since 2017 to be more specific but for many personal reasons I had been postponing it. But it's finally here!

With a mix of old and brand new parts we'll build an ultra versatile and compatible retro computer around the Intel Pentium MMX 233mhz, a processor that has a really special place in my heart.
