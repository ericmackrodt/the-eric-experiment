description: I have built a guitar stand out of wood.

My guitars/bass were taking a lot of space in the office and I had some spare space inside of the closet, so I decided to build this guitar stand that fits perfectly inside of the the space in the closet.

It might not be the most impressive woodworking project in the world, but it's the first time ever that I have built something useful out of wood and actually finished it. For that I'm really proud of the result.

And thanks to my girlfriend Joey for helping me with this.
