description: My first actual attempt at starting a Youtube channel.

Being an avid youtube content consumer for years, I kinda started getting interested in making videos myself. This was my first actual attempt at it, aside from my Lindsey Stirling cover.

I had this silly idea that I would present myself as an Apple enthusiast but I would install Windows on my MacBook, so I came up with "Totally an Apple Enthusiast", which I fucked up in the title of the video and named it "Totally a Mac Enthusiast", whoops.

The video was supposed to be longer, but I overestimated my script... Yeah, there was a script.

I kinda wanted my channel to be kinda like a comedy/tech channel, but focusing more on the comedy side. I know I can be funny but I figured out that shouldn't be my main focus as being intentionally funny is really hard.

An interesting fact was that I didn't actually own that laptop. I was on leave from work and I took my work laptop home. I actually backed up the contents of the hard drive, made the video and then restored the contents.

Yes, it was too much work and risk for a silly 1:21 min video. Here's the result:
