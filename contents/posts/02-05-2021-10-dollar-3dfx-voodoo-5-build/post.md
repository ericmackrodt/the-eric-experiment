description: A build around a 3dfx Voodoo 5 5500 I found for $10 bucks!

About a month ago I found a 3dfx Voodoo 5 5500 at a video-game shop down in Melbourne.

When asking about the price the guy told me it was \$10 bucks, so of course I bought it.

In this part of The Eric Experiment, we're gonna see if this card is working and we're going to build a computer around it!
