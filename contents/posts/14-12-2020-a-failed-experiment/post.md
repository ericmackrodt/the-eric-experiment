description: I tried to run two SD cards in Raid 0 with a PCI RAID controller but it didn't work.

When I was making the Pentium MMX video, because SD cards aren't the fastest thing in the world, I thought it could be a good idea to run two SD cards on Raid 0. That would be cool because it could potentially allow for speeds similar to ATA66 on SD cards.

However, the experiment didn't work, the Windows XP installation would always get stuck after loading the raid drivers with the SD card plugged in. The installation worked using a conventional hard drive and we could potentially run two conventional hard drivers on RAID but that defeats the purpose of replacing ageing hard drivers with SD cards that are easily replaceable.

There maybe is a way to make it work, maybe using a different RAID card or using CF cards instead, however one of the ideas was for it to be easy to use and in as many hardware configurations as possible, so that's why I moved on from this idea.

I made a short video explaining this, make sure to check it out.

It is disappointing but sometimes experiments fail, and that's life.
