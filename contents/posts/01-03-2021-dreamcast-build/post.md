description: In this part of The Eric Experiment, we're gonna build an unique and customized Sega Dreamcast.

The Sega Dreamcast is one of my favorite consoles of all time, and a console I have a bit of a sad history with.

It was a console that I really wanted when I was younger, around 2003 or 2004, but my parents didn't have much money and I didn't have a job, so the idea of getting any video game console seemed a bit out of reach at the time.

So you can imagine how crazy it was that my parents managed to get me one for Christmas.

I played that thing non-stop for about a two or three months when, sadly, it stopped reading disks properly.

My parents got it from a store that was a bit dodgy because that's the only way they could afford it, which means that there was no warranty.

I was really sad but I can't imagine how devastating it was for my parents, one of the few times they managed to get me an amazing gift, it was a complete failure.

Well, now I am an adult with some disposable income and not only can I own 2 Dreamcasts and some spare parts to keep them going, but I also managed to build a custom one that my 14-year-old self would be crazy about.

In this part of the Eric Experiment you can check out the whole build process and a bit of my history with the console.

Also, make sure to checkout the [Dreamcast Resource Page](/dreamcast) which is a bit of a companion for this part of the experiment with some resources about the console and the tools you need to rip games using your console.
