I recently bought a 3d printer, the Creality Ender 3 V2, my first few prints out of it were the demos that came in the sd card and some stuff I got on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com).

After watching some Fusion 360 tutorials on Youtube I decided to give it a crack and design something to print.

But what to design?

Well, I did this while I was working on the the [Voodoo 5 video](/post/02-05-2021-10-dollar-3dfx-voodoo-5-build) and for that video, I needed to keep the Voodoo 5 standing for B-roll shots.

I had made a little stand using foam board, the same material I used in the [Gameboy Display Video](/post/07-06-2020-gameboy-displays)

Since I did it by cutting foam board and gluing it with superglue, the result was a bit crappy.

The idea here is so simple though that it seemed like a good thing to make as my first design.

After that was done I sliced it using Ultimaker Cura, copied to the SD Card and printed it out. Here's the result:

It's not the most impressive thing in the world, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

Now on to more complex things!
