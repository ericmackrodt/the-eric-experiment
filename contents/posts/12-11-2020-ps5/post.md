description: I managed to get the PS5 on launch day, here's how it went.

This is not a normal part of the Experiment, today we're not fixing or playing around with some piece of retro technology, on no no, today we're having a first look at the PS5.

Admittedly this is a fairly unstructured video as it was totally unscripted, I just had a few ideas in my head and just went with it. I required a lot of cutting, especially in the final thoughts, to get a coherent stream of thoughts going.

It's fine though because my main goal here was just to share my experience getting the Playstation 5 on launch day and playing it for the first time.

I don't usually pre-order stuff, nor do I recommend doing it but this time I felt like it would be cool because this is the first time in my life I can actually do it.

As I mentioned in the video, I grew up without much money and, because of that, whenever I had a video game console, it was always one or two generations behind. The PS4, Xbox One and Switch were the first time ever that I could buy consoles within their generation and the PS5 was the first one I could get on launch day.

I kinda did it for my 10-year-old self, if 10-year-old Eric knew about it, he'd be crazy! hahaha

That being said, I don't think I'll do it again, the process is ultra stresfull, frustrating, unnecessary and risky, if they ever make a PS6 or an Xbox Series X 2, I'll probably wait until they are readily available in stores to buy them.
