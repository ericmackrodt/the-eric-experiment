I own two original Sony Playstation 3 controllers, both of which have issues. The first one has a dead battery that can't be charged anymore and the second one seems to have a poltergeist in it becuase it does its own thing, the buttons are pressed by themselves and do whatever they want.

This happens due to the way the buttons membrane are connected to the main board inside of the controller, the connection gets weaker over time causing that issue.

So, in this part of the Eric Experiment, we'll disassemble both controllers and fix those issues.
