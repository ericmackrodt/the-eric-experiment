description: That time I designed a logo for a ship-it event for my company

Okay, this might be a bit overrated because I actually followed a Photoshop tutorial to design this thing.
But hey, it ended up looking pretty good.

I'm no designer, I'm a software engineer by profession, but in December 2018 we were having a hackathon event in my company and we need a logo design so we could make some t-shirts and stickers.

I decided to go with a sythwave design because... It just looks cool okay?

This is the logo I came up with:
