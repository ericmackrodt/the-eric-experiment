## Welcome

Hello! Welcome to The Eric Experiment, I am the Eric from the title!

This is the website where you can check out the projects I have worked on, the stuff I have been trying and more.

If you like retro gaming, retro computing, music and other curious and random stuff, I think you might enjoy following this website or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMackrodt?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>
because most parts of this experiment will be there!
