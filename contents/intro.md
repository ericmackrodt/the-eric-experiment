## Welcome

Hello, my name is Eric and welcome to this experiment which is my life.

This is the website where you can check out the projects I have worked on, the stuff I have been attempting and more.

If you like retro gaming, retro computing, music and other curious and random stuff, I think you might enjoy following this.

Be sure to subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMackrodt?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>
because most parts of this experiment will be there!
