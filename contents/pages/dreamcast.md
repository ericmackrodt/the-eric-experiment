The Sega Dreamcast is one of my favorite consoles of all time, and a console I have a bit of a sad history with.

I really wanted one when I was younger, around 2003 or 2004, but my parents didn't have much money and I didn't have a job, so the idea of getting any video game console seemed a bit out of reach at the time.

So you can imagine how crazy it was that my parents managed to get me one for Christmas, I played that thing non-stop for about a two or three months when, sadly, it stopped reading disks properly.

My parents got it from a store that was a bit dodgy because that's the only way they could afford it, which means that there was no warranty.

I was really sad but I can't imagine how devastating it was for my parents, one of the few times they managed to get me an amazing gift, it was a complete failure.

Regardless it is still a console I'm very fond of and now I own a couple of them so I can still experience it, this page is about it and it contains my curated resources about the console.

## My custom build ##

Growing up in Brazil, buying original games wasn't easy, it was super expensive, so everyone I knew had pirated games for their disk based consoles.

If the GDEMU existed and I had access to it at that time, not only would it have saved my Dreamcast, but I would have probably installed it regardless because the idea of being able to have all of the games I wanted in a very small storage device would've been awesome.

Now, that's the reality of another place and another time, now I live in Australia and I have access to original copies of the games I love. Not only that but I like collecting them, so there's no way I will have pirated copies of games anymore.

With that in mind, there is still a great reason for having a GDEMU, playing backups of my games and not wearing out my GD-ROM drives.

So I decided to build my own dreamcast with everything I would have been crazy about when I was a kid, this was a really fun part of The Experiment to make, so here's the link to the video of the build below:

## Ripping games ##

To use the GD-EMU, I have ripped my games. There are a few methods you can use to do it, the best one probably being the one that uses the Broadband Adaptor to download the disc files on your computer as Adam Koralik outlines here:

![How & Why I Rip All Videogame Discs to a PC - Adam Koralik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElckU57hJFg&t=792)

The problem with that is that I don't have a broadband adaptor and those are going for a premium these days because they are fairly rare, so my only option is to use a serial to sd-card adapter with some piece of software to dump the contents of the disc to the sd-card using the Dreamcast itself.

Here are the options you have to do that plus the download link for them:

[file-download]
  - name: "Dreamshell RC4 4.0"
  - file: "DreamShell_4.0.0_RC4_and_Boot_Loader.7z"
  - url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OEjcLbW9oATsBtUOr2xryNCApwm_u2D2/view?usp=sharing"
  - description:
  This is the option I used, you basically have to burn the boot disk to a blank CD using something like [ImgBurn](#imgburn) and copy the contents of dreamshell to the SD-CARD.

  I found that I had the best luck with 16gb or smaller sd-cards and formatting them using the [SD Card Formatter](#sdcardformatter) that is available on the official [sdcard.org](https://www.sdcard.org/) website.

[file-download]
  - name: "Dreamcast SD Rip v1.1 by jj1dom"
  - file: "Dcsdrip11.zip"
  - url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ilyUATC5o5pfpfxIlYHleKSp0fvfc-Vm/view?usp=sharing"
  - description:
  This is another option for ripping games, it has better feedback of the ripping process compared to Dreamshell, but you need to dump the files on your computer everytime you finish ripping a game as this piece of sofware dumps all the files to the root folder of the sd-card.

  Another cool thing this software can do is backup the bios of your Dreamcast, which you can use in emulators or you can restore it if you installed another bios.

[file-download]
  - name: "SD Card Formatter"
  - file: "SD Card Formatter 5.0.1 Setup.zip"
  - url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u28U5sQW1LVusSKnfXWkNOd8c2A7yDo1/view?usp=sharing"
  - description:
  This is the sd card formatter that is availble in the official [sdcard.org](https://www.sdcard.org/) website. I could only boot Dreamshell after formatting the sd-card with this tool. You can also download it from [here](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/).
[/file-download]

[file-download]
  - name: "ImgBurn"
  - file: "SetupImgBurn_2.5.8.0.exe"
  - url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/12XyPjxcWehxpeIsCfGofjWmReu_du-ps/view?usp=sharing"
  - description:
  This is ImgBurn, the software I used to burn the images on the CDs. You can also download it from its official website [here](https://www.imgburn.com/).

### Preparing GD-EMU after ripping games ###

You can prepare the GD-EMU sd card by using the SD CARD MAKER for GDEMU available below.

[file-download]
  - name: "SD CARD MAKER for GDEMU V1.10"
  - file: "GDEMU_SD.rar"
  - url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ALZgKgaQwdkYdnycFD28_kZ_sk2uEKr/view?usp=sharing"

  This is the software that you can use to prepare the sd card for the GD-EMU with the menu as well as vga and region patches.

  - file: "UGGM_0_7_1.7z"
  - url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OmZO_C5WeIEqfNBFP2hXPCXWO8gPE_N5/view?usp=sharing"
  - description:
  This is another option for setting up your GDEMU sd-card, I haven't tested this one but it seems that it is also able to shrink the size of your gdi images by removing the dummy files from them. You can check out the project page [here](https://github.com/Louhike/Ugly-GDEmu-Games-Manager).
