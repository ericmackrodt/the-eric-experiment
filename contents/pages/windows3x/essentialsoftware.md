### Internet ###

[file-download]
  - name: "Netscape Communicator 4.07"
  - file: "n16e407.zip"
  - url: "/download/16Q6oh7eS5-m5OrWKvThbWLVWU-FOHBj9"
  - description:
  This is the last version of the Netscape Communicator Suite available for Windows 3.x and it's my favorite browser even though it's not as compliant to standards as IE5. It works great for browsing [The Old Net](http://www.theoldnet.com) or using the [Web Rendering Proxy](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp). You can get it to kinda work with [Browservice](https://github.com/ttalvitie/browservice) but the experience is horrible, you can find more information about it [here](/post/02-04-2021-todays-web-on-old-browsers).

  Also make sure to browse this website in it! =)

  The latest version of Internet Explorer for Windows 3.x and it's probably the best browser available for the system. It works great for browsing [The Old Net](http://www.theoldnet.com) or using the [Web Rendering Proxy](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp) but you can also use [Browservice](https://github.com/ttalvitie/browservice) with it even though performance won't be great.

  - description:
  A slightly older and lighter version of IE for Windows 3.x. It also works great for browsing [The Old Net](http://www.theoldnet.com) or using the [Web Rendering Proxy](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp) and, as before, you can also use [Browservice](https://github.com/ttalvitie/browservice) with it even though performance won't be great.

  - description:
  This is Opera 3.62 and it's another alternative for retro-browsing on Windows 3.1. It works great for browsing [The Old Net](http://www.theoldnet.com) or using the [Web Rendering Proxy](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp).

  Just keep in mind that, at the time, Opera was a paid piece of software and this is a trial version that needs a key to activate it.

  Here's a possible activation key, I haven't tested it:

  Oh how I wish I could run Winamp on Windows 3.x, but sadly we can't. This is the next best thing though and I have listened to a lot of music with it in the past. It's a great mp3 player, probably because it was the first realtime mp3 player for Windows.
