# Windows 3.x Links #

Here's a list of websites around DOS and Windows 3.x that still exist... for now.

- [Win31.de](http://www.win31.de/eindex.htm) - This is still one of the best sites with resources and downloads for Windows 3.x, it has existed for a looooong time and I hope stays like that for many years to come.
- [Stephan Großklaß' Homepage](http://stephan.win31.de/home_en.htm) - It has some good resources around computing and Windows 3.x as well the Win32s compatibility list, which is super useful.
- [MDGx Max Speed](http://www.mdgx.com/w31toy.htm) - Full of interesting resources aroudn Windows 3.x and other things.
- [Calmira](http://calmira.de/) - Calmira was a replacement shell for Windows 3.x that makes it look like Windows 95. I've used it a lot in the past, I don't currently use it anymore because if I want the Windows 95 UI I install Windows 95, but it is a great piece of software.
- [CalPaint](http://www.calpaint.de/) - Like the Microsoft Plus! package for Windows 95, CalPaint adds themes to Calmira, you can use some of the pre-defined ones, or create your own.
- [OldOs](http://wiki.oldos.org/index.html) - Another great website with resources around Windows 3.x and other retro computing stuff.

### Not so Windows 3.x ###

A list of websites that are interesting here even though they are not necessarily related to Windows 3.x

- [GUIdebook](https://guidebookgallery.org/index) - This website is focused on showcasing Graphical User Interfaces, it's an interesting resource.
- [SillyDog701 Netscape Browser Archive](http://sillydog.org/narchive/) - This is the Netscape Browser Archive by SillyDog701, the pages are still up but a lot of the links are dead.
- [Evolt Browser Archive](https://browsers.evolt.org/) - This website contains TONS of retro web browsers, it's actually crazy how many there are that I haven't even heard about. Yes, there are browsers for Windows 3.x for download.
